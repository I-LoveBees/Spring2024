Robot arm concepts for a different type of claw machine that features a hand-like claw as the main appendage.
Arm will drag object into prize hole, using the palm like a scoop and the fingers as an extra hold.

Robot prototype has rings around it for added intrest and so the robot can turn in more ways than one.
Finished Robot model by adding a few more small details, but overall kept it simple to be easily understood
